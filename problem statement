Assignment

In this assignment, your task is to analyze the 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T10YIE) — a market-based measure of inflation expectations — and apply multiple time-series techniques to extract actionable insights.
The project simulates a real-world financial analytics challenge where you are expected to explore the dataset, detect structural patterns, and interpret how market sentiment toward inflation evolved between 2020 and 2025.

By combining classical statistical methods with visualization-driven analysis, you will uncover how economic events such as the post-pandemic recovery, monetary tightening, and geopolitical shocks shaped long-term inflation expectations.

# Objective:  
Perform a comprehensive trend analysis using the following three techniques:

Moving Averages – Identify long-term and short-term trends in inflation expectations.    
Year-over-Year Change – Quantify momentum shifts compared to the previous year.   
Bollinger Bands – Detect volatility and periods of extreme market behavior.   

# Data Description

The dataset is sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) under the series name T10YIE.    
It represents the difference between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields — the market’s implied inflation rate over a 10-year horizon.     

# Dataset Information:

Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)  
Frequency: Daily   
Period: October 2020 – October 2025   
Columns:   
observation_date: Date of observation (daily frequency)   
T10YIE: 10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (%)     
Observations: ~1,300     
Range: 1.64 % – 3.02 %      
Average: 2.33 %       
The dataset captures major macroeconomic events — including the post-COVID stimulus, the 2022 inflation surge, Federal Reserve tightening cycles, and eventual market normalization.   

# Analytical Techniques   
Each of the three methods answers a different question about inflation expectations:   

Technique	Objective	Insight Type   
Moving Averages	Smooth short-term fluctuations	Trend detection   
Year-over-Year Change	Compare current vs. last year’s value	Momentum & acceleration   
Bollinger Bands	Measure volatility around trend	Extremes & normalization   
Findings Summary   
Key Observations    
2020–2021: Sharp rise in inflation expectations during global recovery.   
2022: Extreme volatility, with expectations peaking near 3 % amid geopolitical shocks.    
2023: Decline as monetary tightening restored confidence.     
2024–2025: Stabilization near 2.3 %, aligning with the Fed’s target.     
Market Interpretation   
Moving Averages captured early turning points in the inflation cycle.    
Year-over-Year Change exposed acceleration and cooling phases invisible in the raw chart.     
Bollinger Bands revealed volatility spikes and normalization periods tied to macroeconomic events.   

Business Implications   
For Policymakers:    
Narrow Bollinger Bands and stable moving averages indicate market confidence in inflation control.    
For Investors:   
YoY momentum shifts act as early warning signals for upcoming interest-rate adjustments.   
For Analysts:    
Combining multiple trend-analysis techniques deepens interpretability and prevents misreading of short-term fluctuations.   
Takeaway:   
Inflation expectations react sharply to shocks but tend to re-anchor once monetary credibility is restored.    
Understanding these dynamics helps organizations anticipate sentiment changes and improve risk forecasting.    

Practicalities    
Present your work as a concise analytical notebook or report, clearly showing methodology, visual insights, and interpretation.   
Focus on how each technique contributes a unique perspective to the same dataset.   

Deliverables  

Python notebook or script performing full analysis    
Visualizations for each technique      
Short written summary of insights and economic relevance    
Estimated Completion Time: ~6–8 hours   

Tips   
Forward-fill missing values (ffill) to preserve daily continuity.   
Convert dates with pd.to_datetime before plotting to prevent epoch errors.   
Use matplotlib.dates to simplify long-range x-axis labels.   
Link observed patterns to real macroeconomic events (rate hikes, wars, policy changes).   
Keep visuals clear — focus on narrative clarity over complex styling.
